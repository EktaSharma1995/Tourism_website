				<strong>Welcome to Punjab,</strong> Punjab is a state in northern
				India, forming part of the larger Punjab region. The state is
				bordered by the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir to the north,
				Himachal Pradesh to the east, and Haryana to the south and
				southeast, Rajasthan to the southwest, and the Pakistan province of
				Punjab to the west. The state capital is located in Chandigarh, a
				Union Territory and also the capital of the neighbouring state of
				Haryana. After the partition of India in 1947, the Punjab province
				of British India was divided between India and Pakistan. The Indian
				Punjab was divided on the basis of language in 1966. It was divided
				into 3 parts. Haryanvi speaking areas (dialect of Hindi) were carved
				out as Haryana, Hilly regions and Pahari speaking areas formed
				Himachal Pradesh alongside the current state of Punjab.
