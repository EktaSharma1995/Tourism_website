				<strong>Welcome to J&K,</strong> Jammu and Kashmir is a state in
				northern India, often denoted by the acronym J&K. It is located
				mostly in the Himalayan mountains, and shares borders with the
				states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south. Jammu and
				Kashmir has an international border with China in the north and
				east, and the Line of Control separates it from the
				Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and
				Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and northwest respectively. The state
				has special autonomy under Article 370 of the Constitution of India.

				Jammu and Kashmir consists of three regions: Jammu, the Kashmir
				Valley and Ladakh. Srinagar is the summer capital, and Jammu is the
				winter capital. Jammu and Kashmir is the only state in India with a
				Muslim-majority population. The Kashmir valley is famous for its
				beautiful mountainous landscape, and Jammu's numerous shrines
				attract tens of thousands of Hindu pilgrims every year. Ladakh, also
				known as "Little Tibet", is renowned for its remote mountain beauty
				and Buddhist culture.

			<p>Gulmarg is a town, a hill station, a popular skiing
				destination and a notified area committee in the Baramula district
				of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.The town is situated in the
				Pirpanjal range in the western Himalayas. Originally named Gaurimarg
				("the fair one") by shepherds in honor of the Hindu goddess Parvati,
				the resort was renamed Gulmarg(“meadow of flowers”) by Sultan Yusuf
				Shah of the Chak Dynasty who frequented the place with his queen
				Habba khatoon in the 16th century.Wild flowers of 21 different
				varieties were collected by the Mughal emperor Jahangir for his
				gardens in Gulmarg. In the 19th century, British civil servants
				started using Gulmarg as a retreat to escape summers in North Indian
				plains. Hunting and golfing were their favorite pastime and three
				golf courses were established in Gulmarg including one exclusively
				for women.One of the golf courses survives and at an altitude of
				2,650 metres (8,690 ft) is the world's highest golf course.In 1927,
				British established a ski club in Gulmarg and two annual ski events
				were hosted one each during Christmas and Easter.Central Asian
				explorer Aurel Stein also visited Gulmarg during this period.</p>

				6-km walk from the Gulmarg bus stop and car park. The meadow,
				carpeted with flowers in the spring, is the site for Gulmarg’s
				winter ski runs and offers a fine view of the surrounding peaks and
				over the Kashmir Valley. It’s a 600-metre ascent from Gulmarg to
				Khilanmarg and during the early spring, as the snowmelts, it can be
				a very muddy hour’s climb up the hill. The effort is rewarded, if
				it’s clear, with a sweeping view to of the great Himalayas from
				Nanga Parbat to the twin 7,100-metre peaks of Nun and Kun to the
				southeast.</p>

				<a href="http://www.humber.ca" target="_blank">Tours to Kargil</a>
			</h1>
			<img src="images/Kargil.jpg" alt="Kargil" height="250px"
				width="500px">
			<p>Kargil is a city in the Kargil district of Ladakh region, in
				the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is the second largest town
				in Ladakh after Leh. It is located 60 km and 204 km from Drass and
				Srinagar to the west respectively, 234 km from Leh to the east, 240
				km from Padum to the southeast and 1,047 km from Delhi to the south.

				Present-day Kargil was not the natural capital of the region, or
				Purig as it was also known. Earlier, Purig consisted of a number of
				small but independent kingdoms, which included Chiktan, Sot and the
				Suru Valley. These tiny principalities would often fight among
				themselves over petty issues. Gasho “Thatha Khan”, an exiled
				Buddhist prince in the 9th century AD, is perhaps the first ruler
				who brought together all the territories under a united
				administration. Another sultan of Purig extended his kingdom to
				include Zanskar, Pashkum (Jammu and Kashmir) and Sodh, pretty much
				the territory of the present Kargil district. He is referred to as
				“the Purig Sultan”. His capital was based at Karpokhar in the Suru
				Valley. The other famous kings of Kargil were Boti Khan, Abdal Khan,
				Amrood Choo, Tsering Malik, Kunchok Sherab Stan and Thi Sultan.</p>

			<img src="images/leh.jpg" alt="Leh" height="250px" width="500px">
			<p>Leh was the capital of the Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh, now
				the Leh district in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Leh
				district, with an area of 45,110 km2, is the second largest district
				in the country, after Kutch, Gujarat (in terms of area). The town is
				dominated by the ruined Leh Palace, the former mansion of the royal
				family of Ladakh, built in the same style and about the same time as
				the Potala Palace-the chief residence of the Dalai Lama until the
				14th Dalai Lama fled to Dharamshala, India, during the 1959 Tibetan
				uprising. Leh is at an altitude of 3,524 metres (11,562 ft), and is
				connected via National Highway 1D to Srinagar in the southwest and
				to Manali in the south via the Leh-Manali Highway. In 2010, the
				sudden floods caused by a cloud burst heavily damaged Leh.</p>
