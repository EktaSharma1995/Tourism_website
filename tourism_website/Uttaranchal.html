				Uttaranchal, is a state in the northern part of India. It is often

				many Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres found throughout the
				state. Uttarakhand is known for the natural environment of the
				Himalayas, the Bhabhar and the Terai. On 9 November 2000,
				Uttarakhand became the 27th state of the Republic of India, being
				created from the Himalayan and adjoining northwestern districts of
				Uttar Pradesh. It borders Tibet to the north; the Mahakali Zone of
				the Far-Western Region, Nepal to the east; and the Indian states of
				Uttar Pradesh to the south and Himachal Pradesh to the west and
				north-west as well as Haryana on its south-western corner. The state
				is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon, with a total of
				13 districts. The interim capital of Uttarakhand is Dehradun, the
				largest city of the state, which is a railhead. The High Court of
				the state is located in Nainital.
