				<strong>Welcome to Himanchal Pradesh,</strong> Himachal Pradesh
				literally "Abode of Snow" is a state of India located in North
				India. It is bordered by Jammu and Kashmir on the north, Punjab and
				Chandigarh on the west, Haryana on the southwest, Uttarakhand on the
				southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the east. At its
				southernmost point, it also touches the state of Uttar Pradesh. The
				name was coined from the Sanskrit—Him means 'snow' and achal means
				'land' or 'abode'—by Acharya Diwakar Datt Sharma, one of the state's
				eminent Sanskrit scholars. Himachal Pradesh is known for its natural
				environment, hill stations, and temples. Himachal Pradesh had the
				fifteenth highest per-capita income of Indian states and union
				territories for the year 2013-14. Many perennial rivers flow in the
				state. Numerous plants produce surplus hydroelectricity that is sold
				to other states, such as Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan.Tourism and
				agriculture are additional important parts of the state's economy.

				history of the Chamba region to the Kolian tribes in the 2nd century
				BC, the area was formally ruled by the Maru dynasty, starting with
				the Raju Maru from around 500 AD, ruling from the ancient capital of
				Bharmour, which is located 75 kilometres (47 mi) from the town of
				Chamba. In 920, Raja Sahil Varman (or Raja Sahil Verma) shifted the
				capital of the kingdom to Chamba, following the specific request of

				the Kangra Valley in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh,
				surrounded by tea gardens and pine forests before they merge with
				the Dhauladhar ranges. Palampur is the tea capital of northwest
				India but tea is just one aspect that makes Palampur a special
				interest place. Abundance of water and proximity to the mountains
				has endowed it with mild climate. Palampur is also hometown of Capt.
				Vikram Batra who was awarded Paramvir Chakra (posthumous). The town
				has derived its name from the local word palum, meaning lots of
				water. There are numerous streams flowing from the mountains to the
				plains from Palampur. The combination of greenery and water gives
				Palampur a distinctive look. Palampur is at the confluence of the
				plains and the hills and so the scenery shows the contrast: plains
				on one side and the majestic snow-covered hills on the other side.
				In the backdrop of this beautiful town stands the Dhauladhar
				mountain range, which remains snow-covered for most part of the
				year.</p>
